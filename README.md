# Volundeer - Purpose with Fun
26th May 2024

## Project Description

Our volunteering platform brings communities together by making volunteering fun and engaging. Volunteers earn points and badges for their efforts, adding a sense of achievement and friendly competition through gamification. The platform also features a proposal system where users can suggest and vote on new volunteer projects. This way, popular ideas get noticed and organizations can see what the community cares about most. By encouraging active participation and recognizing contributions, we aim to strengthen community bonds.

## Selected Track
